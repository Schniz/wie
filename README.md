# ![this is vlad. nice to meet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Schniz/wie/master/public/images/shortcut-icon.png) WHERE THE FUCK IS EVERYBODY?

ohhhh here you are.
I can't code so I wrote this shit and I won't take responsibility for it.

- Ember.js for client side
- Express/Mongo w/Monami for the REST resources stuff
- Socket.IO
- Hammer.js for touch events garbage.
- Mounts to openshift. openshift is pretty awesome.

I use pretty sweet libraries and destroy their great name.
found a bug? fix my shitty code.
thanks bye :heart: :heart: :heart:
